### Prompt design

The `theme`  set as a `product review service system`.

```python
log_prompt = (
    f"In addition, here is a summary of the log of {labels[i]} and {labels[j]} from another expert who is very familiar with the {theme}\n "
    f"The summary of node {labels[i]} is as follows:\n\n{log_dict[labels[i]]}\n\n"
    f"The summary of node {labels[j]} is as follows:\n\n{log_dict[labels[j]]}\n\n"
)
```

```python
prompt = (
    f"In a {theme}, the following {'nodes' if node_mode else 'pods'} are included:\n\n"
    f"{', '.join(pod_list)[:-2]}\n\n"
    f"Now, I will provide the log information about the {'node' if node_mode else 'pod'}: {pod_name} in the following format:\n\n"
    f"---\n"
    f"Event template is <|EventTemplate|>, with event ID <|EventId|>, occurred <|Occurrence|> times.\n\n"
    f"Here are some examples of this template:\n\n"
    f"* The event occurred at <|Time|>, and its content was <|Content|>.\n"
    f"* The event occurred at <|Time|>, and its content was <|Content|>.\n"
    f"---\n\n"
    f"Below are all the event templates and the examples they contain:\n\n"
    f"{generate_pod_log(pod_template, pod_structured,record_num)}\n"
    f"Based on the above content, please provide your summary of this {'node' if node_mode else 'pod'}: {pod_name}, including:\n\n"
    f"* The role of the {'node' if node_mode else 'pod'}: {pod_name} in the system\n"
    f"* The probability of the {'node' if node_mode else 'pod'}: {pod_name} experiencing anomalies\n"
    f"* The possible relationships this {'node' if node_mode else 'pod'}: "
    f"{pod_name} has with other {'nodes' if node_mode else 'pods'} that are shown in the above {'nodes' if node_mode else 'pods'} list.\n\n"
    f"You only need to provide the information about this {'node' if node_mode else 'pod'}: {pod_name}.\n\n"
    f"Your response:\n"
